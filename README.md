# Economic-Regime-Asset-Allocation-With-Fred
Model Overview & Interpretation

This project implements a macro-driven, volatility-aware asset allocation framework designed to dynamically allocate across equity, factor, defensive, and cash sleeves. The model ingests a set of macroeconomic indicators (e.g., GDP growth, inflation, money supply, velocity, and interest-rate levels), transforms them into standardized z-scores, and aggregates them into a continuous risk_on score ranging from 0 (fully risk-off) to 1 (fully risk-on). Rather than relying solely on discrete economic regimes, this continuous signal allows the portfolio to scale exposure gradually as macro conditions improve or deteriorate.

At each monthly rebalance, the model blends between predefined risk-on and risk-off base allocations using the current risk_on score, then applies inverse-volatility scaling so that higher-volatility assets (e.g., momentum ETFs) do not dominate portfolio risk relative to lower-volatility sleeves (e.g., minimum-volatility or value factors). Daily returns are generated using forward-filled monthly signals, and portfolio performance is evaluated against an equal-weight benchmark. In addition to historical backtests, the script outputs current recommended portfolio weights as of the latest trading day, making the framework suitable for both retrospective analysis and real-time decision-making.
